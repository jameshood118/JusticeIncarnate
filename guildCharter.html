	Justice Incarnate is a Horde-side end-game raiding guild on Thorium Brotherhood. The guild's goal is to progress through the end game content such as Karazhan, Gruul's Lair, and beyond. The guild will not enforce specs on people, though raid formation will require that certain roles be filled. Our primary focus is raiding, though if players enjoy PvPing or RPing, that is fine, but it is not required nor will it be a primary guild focus. Most importantly while progressing through the raids we want to have fun. This is a game plain and simple and so we should be having fun while playing. We will aim to make this the standard in playing. 
	<BR /><BR /><br />
	<hr />
	
	The guild structure is as follows: 
	<BR /><BR />
	
	<b>Emperor </b>
	This is the leader of the guild. This is Kazeir. He will run the guild fairly and with impartiality. 
	<BR /><BR />
	
	<b>Baron </b>
	These members are the Emperor's "right hand men". They are responsible for handling any guild issues and recruiting new members. 
	<BR /><BR />
	
	<b>Historian</b><br />
	The Historians are the Old World content leaders.  Currently this means Azeroth instances and raids, but as the new expansion comes out, will include Outlands instances and raids.
	<br /><br />
	
	<b>Knight </b><br />
	These are your instance and raid leaders.  Their responsibility includes organizing and running raids each night, as they are available of course.  The Knight's goal is to see at least one guild run every night, if not more, depending on how many guildies are available.  The Knight will know and be friends with the LFG tool in case a full guild run cannot be formed. 
	<BR /><BR />
	
	<b>Crusader</b><br />
	Crusader are Justice Incarnate's active raiders.  These are the members that desire to raid every week whenever a raid is available.  They are the members that sign up for the raids (whether space requirements allow them to come or not).  A Crusader's responsibilities include gearing themselves up and coming prepared to raids.  This means that the Crusader will be constantly trying to improve their gear to raid level gear through both regular instance runs and heroics, whichever is required to improve their gear.  They will also be responsible for coming to raids prepared.  This means with potions, reagents, gear is repaired, ammo, and anything else that will be needed for a successful raid.  Crusader will be given preference in raid selection if they have fulfilled their responsibilites as listed above.  Crusaders have access to the guild bank.
	<br /><br />
	
	<b>Reaper </b>
	Most members will have this title. Reaper are the accepted members of the guild, who have made it through the trial period and are now part of the fold.  Reapers are not required to raid, though they are welcome to raid with the guild if there is space available.  Reapers have access to the guild bank.
	<BR /><BR />
	
	<b>Grunt </b>
	Grunts are the common soldier in the guild, when you are given this rank, you prove to the guild that you have made it through the short period of being a Fluffy Bunny, while Fluffy Bunny initially serves as a reminder to the officers that people of that rank are less than 3 days old in the guild, Grunt is still a trial rank, but with less restrictions than Fluffy Bunny. Grunts can view the Guild bank but cannot withdraw without an officer helping them.
	<BR /><BR />
	
	<b>Fluffy Bunny </b>
	While a guild member has this title, he or she is in a trial period with the guild, and can be kicked form the guild if causing trouble or not participating in guild instance runs or raids.  This trial period is the time in which the guild gets to know you. Fluffy Bunny does not have access to the guild bank, or any of its assets.
	<BR /><BR /><br />
	<hr />
	
	<b>Raiding and Expectations of the Guild </b><br />
	Raiding and progressing through end game is the number one focus of this guild.  Raids (and instances) will be posted on Group Calendar, hence why Group Calendar is required by all guild members.  Signing up for these raids is how we plan the raids.
	<BR /><BR />
	
	Our current raiding schedule is as follows:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Zul'Aman</b> - Off Mondays from Gruuls at 9 PM Server time, and any additional times that the raid leaders see as possible</li>
	<li><b>Karazhan</b> - Friday - Mondays 9 PM Server time</li>
	<li><b>Gruul's Lair</b> - Every other Monday 9 PM Server Time</li>
	<li><b>Old World Raids</b> - Sunday 7 PM Server Time</li>
	<li><b>SSC/TK</b> - Sundays</li>
	<BR /><BR />
	Our new raiding schedule (goes into effect April):
	<ul>
	<li><b>Zul'Aman</b> - Off Mondays from Gruuls at 9 PM Server time, and any additional times that the raid leaders see as possible</li>
	<li><b>Karazhan</b> - Tuesdays 9 PM Server time</li>
	<li><b>Gruul's Lair</b> - Every other Monday 9 PM Server Time</li>
	<li><b>Old World Raids</b> - Sunday 7 PM Server Time</li>
	<li><b>SSC/TK</b> - Friday & Saturday</li>
	<BR /><BR />
	
	Please be kind to your guildmates. If our goal is to grow and progress together through the game then we need to have a friendly and relaxed atmosphere to play in. If you have a problem with a guildmate, please discuss this problem privately with a Baron, Historian, or the Emporer. Please do not bash people in guild chat or ventrilo. Be respectful of people in both guild chat and ventrilo. Remember there are ladies present so please remember this in your words, both spoken and typed. Also some of our members may have young children listening while they are on Ventrilo. Because of this please refrain from cursing or having offensive vent phoentics. 
	<BR /><BR /><br />
	<hr />
	
	<b>Required Addons </b><br />
	We do not require addons to make your life miserable. There is a method to our madness. The required addons are used to make our raids successful. In a raid it is very important to watch your threat, as well as to have instant voice communication. Raids may be possible without these things but we believe it's better to be safe than have a fifty gold repair bill! So please see that you download these addons. Feel free to ask an officer if you are have issues with one of the required addons.  You may lose your position in a raid if you do not have the required addons.
	<BR /><BR /><br />
	<hr />
	
	<b>Minimum Level to Join the Guild </b><br />
	The minimum level required for Justice Incarnate is level 58 at this time.  This requirement does not apply to friends, family, or alts of current members.  This limitation may be reconsidered on a case by case basis.
