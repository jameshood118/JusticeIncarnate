	<b>December 29, 2007</b><br />
	<i>FULL KARAZHAN CLEAR!!!</i>  A scant 5 months after JI has formed, we have done a full Karazhan clear.  Considering when we started we are all mostly in greens and some blues, no purples, this is an amazing job.  While we will continue farming Kara in the new year, we are also ready to start pushing forward into ZA.  Congratulations on all your hard work Justice Incarnate.  May the new year put us into SSC and beyond!<br /><br />

This weekend we visited <a href="galleries/zgGallery.html" class="menuLink">Zul'Gurub</a>.  Also nominated Jelana to be the Historian, a new rank indicating his responsibility for Old World content.  Gratz Jelana!
